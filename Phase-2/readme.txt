The code has 2 files. index.py and search.py. 
The syntax to run these are as follows:

```python index.py <path to dump> <path to index folder>
python search.py <path to index folder> <path to query file>```

Search and Index are implemented completely in their respective files. 

Please note that the stats mentioned in the stats.txt file are extrapolations of the 
current size of my inverted_index size. The index code was running at the moment of submitting this code.
